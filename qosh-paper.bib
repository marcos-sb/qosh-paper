    abstract = {{The MapReduce programming model, introduced by Google, offers a simple and efficient way of performing distributed computation over large data sets. 
    Although Google's implementation is proprietary, MapReduce can be leveraged by anyone using the free and open source Apache Hadoop framework. To simplify the usage 
    of Hadoop in the cloud, Amazon Web Services offers Elastic MapReduce, a web service enabling users to run MapReduce jobs. Elastic MapReduce takes care of resource provisioning, 
    Hadoop configuration and performance tuning, data staging, fault tolerance, etc. This service drastically reduces the entry barrier to perform MapReduce computations in the cloud, 
    allowing users to concentrate on the problem to solve. However, Elastic MapReduce is restricted to Amazon EC2 resources, and is provided at an additional cost. In this paper, we present Resilin, 
    a system implementing the Elastic MapReduce API with resources from other clouds than Amazon EC2, such as private and community clouds. 
    Furthermore, we explore a feature going beyond the current Amazon Elastic MapReduce offering: performing MapReduce computations over multiple distributed clouds.}},
